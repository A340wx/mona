* How to debug Mona application using remote GDB.

  1. On your main() function, call DebuggerService::breakpoint() function. This enables GDB remote debug handlers.
  2. Compile you program with -g flag (Default behaviour)
  3. Start your QEMU with -serial file:/tmp/mona.log -serial tcp::43770,server . The second -serial option is used by GDB.
  4. Run gdb as follows.
     gdb YOUR.EXE
     (gdb) target remote localhost:43770
  5. GDB will break on your first DebuggerService::breakpointI().
