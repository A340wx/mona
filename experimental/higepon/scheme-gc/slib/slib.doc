NAME
       SLIB - Scheme Library

SYNOPSIS
       slib [ scm | gsi | mzscheme | guile | slib48 | scheme48 | scmlit ]

DESCRIPTION
       "SLIB" is a portable library for the programming language "Scheme".  It
       provides a platform  independent  framework  for  using  "packages"  of
       Scheme  procedures and syntax.  As distributed, SLIB contains many use-
       ful packages.  Its catalog can be transparently extended to  accomodate
       packages specific to a site, implementation, user, or directory.

OPTIONS
       The  optional  argument to the slib script is the Scheme implementation
       to run.  Absent the argument, it searches for  implementations  in  the
       above order.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       SCHEME_LIBRARY_PATH
              is the SLIB Scheme library directory (with a trailing "/").

FILES
       slib.info
              Texinfo documentation of slib.

AUTHORS
       Aubrey Jaffer (agj @ alum.mit.edu) and scores of others.

       The  full  documentation for slib is maintained as a Texinfo manual. If
       the info and slib programs are properly installed  at  your  site,  the
       command
              info slib

       should give you access to the complete manual.
